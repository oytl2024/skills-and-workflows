# BrainWorkflow TODO

### Requirement Summary
- Create `BrainWorkflow/` under `oytl2024/skills-and-workflows` as the clean project repository folder for the WorldQuant BRAIN workflow.
- Continue from the approved Phase 2 principle-led research workflow design.

### Confirmed Boundaries
- Include maintainable code, tests, configuration, design docs, implementation plans, and compiled/general knowledge.
- Exclude credentials, raw run artifacts, raw platform snapshots, temporary directories, and old root-level scripts with local assumptions.
- Do not hardcode API credentials.

### Current Next Step
- Implement the Phase 2 principle-led research planner from:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-wqb-phase2-principle-led-research-workflow-design.md`

### Repository Status

- Initial commit: `f42c5da`
- Draft PR: https://github.com/oytl2024/skills-and-workflows/pull/1
